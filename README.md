# HelloAzureFunctions

A Basic starter project to get going with Azure functions. It is broadly based on the default app and instructions from Tim Corey's youtube tutorial
(Intro to Azure Functions - What they are and how to create and deploy them)[https://github.com/youngwt/HelloAzureFunctions.git]

The application listens to requests and currently returns a message to say that is has received those requests. I have
set up a webhook on this repo to call the live url in Azure whenever a push is made to this repo.
